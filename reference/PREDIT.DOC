PREDIT is a SAV file EDITOR for Privateer by Origin.  This 2.1 upgrade to
version 2.0 allows you to change the following game variables:

	1)	pilot cash credits,
	2)	ship type and location (relocate to any of the 60 bases),
	3)	number of missions,
	4)	mission selection (change to a different plot mission or
		  force the completion of the active mission),
	5)	pilot name and callsign,
	6)	missile and torpedo loadouts,
	7)	gun types and locations (including alien Steltek guns),
	8)	super shield levels (up to Shield Generator Level 11), and
	9)	engine upgrades.

A unique DATABASE feature has been included.  You can store individual
vehicle component records (edited or unedited) in the database file.  This
file can then be used by yourself or others who want to selectively upgrade
their individual vehicles.  For example, if you create a "super engine" record,
you can now store that record in the database where your friends can "install"
it on their vehicles.  Put your database file on a network or bulletin-board
service for LOTS of people to use!

A FULL HEX/ASCII editor is available for "tailoring" your SAV files, individual
SAV file records, and the records stored in the database.

PREDIT provides simple utilities for those who don't want to "experiment" with
their SAV files -- they just need to complete a mission, or they want better
shields, engines, more $$$, etc.  It also now caters better to those who want
to edit SAV file data and create their own custom vehicle components.  Plus you
can now store these components and share them with others.

BIG WARNING:   The author has found that the editing of some vehicle SAV file
components causes Privateer to HALT your system.  BACKUP THOSE SAV FILES BEFORE
EDITING!!!

An updated version of the author's database file, PRECS.DAT, has been included.
It contains various vehicle component records including some internal engine
records the game uses for creating enemy and alien vehicle engines.  Call up
the database menu and view the record listing.  Items labeled "GENGINE" are the internal game engines.  Experiment with these engines -- some are quite
interesting.

The DEBUG switch is still active for viewing all debug listings.  Some of these
listings get quite long, but if you want to write your own Privateer analysis or
edit routines, this is a great place to start!

A few users reported PREDIT problems when trying to manipulate SAV files which
contained saved missions.  Their computers either halted or went into endless
loops when PREDIT tried to load a SAV file containing more than one saved
mission.  (Privateer can save up to three missions acquired from either the
Mission Computer, Mercenary Guild, or Merchants Guild. It will also keep track
of where you are in the primary plot line missions.)  This version of PREDIT
WILL READ AND PROCESS ALL TYPES OF SAV FILES, INCLUDING THOSE WITH SEVERAL
SAVED MISSIONS STORED IN THEM.  If any more file structure related problems
arise, please contact the author.








*******************************************************************************
                          INSTALLATION
Installation is easy.  Just copy PREDIT.EXE, PRECS.DAT, and this text file
(if desired) to your Privateer directory (\privater, usually).  Run PREDIT by
typing "predit" followed by the SAV file you want to modify. (Privateer SAV
files are created by the game's SAVE command.  You enter a name, up to 8 chars,
and the game adds a ".sav" suffix.  These files are stored in your game
directory.)  You MUST type the SAV file's FULL NAME INCLUDING THE SAV SUFFIX.
For example, if your SAV file is named "myfile.sav", run this routine by typing
"predit myfile.sav".

You will be prompted for viewing DEBUG info.  Answer 'n' if you don't want to
view it.  Next, you'll be given a menu of things to do.  Follow the on screen
directions.  If you make a mistake, try to go back and fix it and worst case,
exit PREDIT without saving your SAV file.  This is a simple routine - nothing
else to do!

*******************************
PLEASE NOTE -- Compare parameters listed by PREDIT with the game's parameter
listings (using your "PERSONAL COMPUTER" or the "SHIP DEALER" in the game).
If you want to verify your equipment loading, go to the "SHIP DEALER" and
select "SELL" mode in the "REPAIR AND UPGRADE" area.  Scroll through the
computer listing and verify that you indeed have the equipment you want. If
you find ANY discrepancies between PREDIT's data (such as a cash credit
amount) and the game's data, please DO NOT KEEP ANY CHANGES TO YOUR SAV FILE!
I tried to ensure that all SAV file record-length problems were accounted for,
but if an unexpected record type slips by my record checking and formatting
routines, you may be given erroneous file data.

PLEASE NOTE AGAIN -- If you are doing your own edits via the HEX editor and
the database system, this is a great way to check your results.  For example,
if you load a database MISL record and insert it into your SAV file, make sure
those new missiles show up under the "SELL" area at the "SHIP DEALER".  If they
don't show up -- chances are you need to do more experimentation (see the ref
to the "F" database record described below).

*******************************************************************************
                 CHANGING AND COMPLETING PLOT LINE MISSIONS
One of the new features of PREDIT 2.1 is the ability to change to a new plot
line mission and also to "force" complete a plot mission that you've been
unable to successfully finish.  MAIN MENU item <5> takes you to the MISSION
SELECTION menu.  You will notice that PREDIT tries to analyze your current
active plot mission and will give you a display of several parameters.  Notice
that the mission analysis shows you a mission number as well as the current
SITUATION and MISSION.  The following paragraph summarizes Privateer plot
line SITUATIONS and MISSIONS.

Privateer plot missions are grouped as SITUATIONS with each situation containing
one or more MISSIONS.  Once you complete the missions in a SITUATION, you
proceed to the next SITUATION.  Situations are grouped primarily according to
your star base location and the people you interact with.  Privateer currently
has 6 situations numbered 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7.  The missions in each
situation are numbered as A, B, C, and D.  Situation 0, Mission A is the first
plot mission in the game where you go to New Detroit and meet Sandoval.  The
following listing summarizes the situations and missions, and the individuals
you interact with.

SITUATION	MISSIONS	PERSON			COMMENTS
0		A		Sandoval		Only 1 Sandoval mission.
1		ABCD		Tayla			4 missions.
2		ABCD		Lynch			4 missions.
3		ABCD		Masterson		4 missions.
4		ABCD		Murphy/Monkhouse 	4 missions.
5		ABCD		Cross			4 missions.
7		AB		Admiral Terrell		2 missions, and a time
							delay between the end of
							Situation 5 and the
							start of Situation 7.

If you choose to COMPLETE a mission, the mission will be flagged as DONE. Note
that other mission objectives may NOT be finished.  For example, Situation 4
Mission C requires you to break the blockade and meet Dr. Monkhouse on Palan.
PREDIT will complete the mission for you, but you will have to put your ship
at Palan if you are not already there (MAIN MENU item <3>).

Mission Selection Menu item <1> lets you select a new plot mission.  PREDIT
does this by placing you at the END OF THE PREVIOUS MISSION.  Once back in
the game, you must do whatever is required to start the new mission -- talk
to someone in the bar, library, etc.  This forces Privateer to set up the new
mission for you.  PREDIT will place your ship at the correct location for
starting the new mission.

CAUTION -- Some game missions are part of a series that "builds" data as you
progress, i.e., you get more NAV points in the Situation 5 Exploratory Service
missions as you do more missions.  If you choose a new mission and you notice
you're missing important data, you may need to back up a few missions and start
there.





*******************************************************************************
                         SAV FILE HEX/ASCII EDITOR
PREDIT provides a general HEX/ASCII editor that shows up in several places.
If you want to edit a byte or two while viewing the ENTIRE SAV file, select
MAIN MENU item <13>.  Just enter the byte offset and hex value (lower case
only).  Press <Return> with no entries to exit.  This is a good place to
check the results of your individual SAV file record or database record edits
described below.





*******************************************************************************
                    INDIVIDUAL SAV FILE RECORD EDITS
Selecting MAIN MENU item <12> takes you to the RECORD EDITING AND SAVING MENU.
This is where you edit individual SAV file records and do all database work.
Item <1> presents you with a list of the loaded SAV file records ordered in a
one-up manner.  Enter the number of the record you want to edit or view.
There's always an <EXIT> in the list for aborting this menu.  All record
names are short ASCII text names and a couple are short -- 1 or 2 characters.
These names are CRITICAL, so changing them usually HALTS YOUR SYSTEM when the
game runs!  The HEX/ASCII editor presents you with the record's contents.  Edit
the data if you want to, and exit by typing <done> at the prompt.

All edits you make to SAV file records are immediately incorporated into your
SAV file BUFFER.  They are NOT saved to disk until you specifically SAVE your
SAV file( item <14> in the MAIN MENU.)   Abort PREDIT with no saves if you
edit the wrong data.





*******************************************************************************
                       PREDIT DATABASE OVERVIEW
Since Privateer stores a large part of its vehicle data in your SAV file
FORMS and RECORDS, the author thought it would be a good idea to be able to
selectively store these vehicle "components" in a database for later usage.
If you edit a record in your SAV file which gives you "super shields" for
example, save your unique record into the database.  Once in the database,
the record can be used with other SAV files.  Now everyone can have your
"super shields"!

The database file is called "PRECS.DAT".  The file structure is simple and is
given here for those wanting to alter it.  PREDIT allows you to control whether
a database record is "ACTIVE" or "ERASED".  If erased, the record is still in
the database, but doesn't show up when item <2>, RETRIEVE/EDIT a DATABASE
RECORD, of the RECORD EDITING AND SAVING MENU is called (item <12> in the MAIN
MENU).

A sample PRECS.DAT file is included with this package.  This file includes a
record called "F".  The "F" record is sometimes found as the LAST RECORD IN FORM
4.  The author found that replaced MISL records in FORM 4 (MISL records list
the type and number of missiles on your vehicle) sometimes caused Privateer to
corrupt the engine and shield components.  Adding an "F" record immediately
after the MISL record in FORM 4 seemed to fix engine and shield problems.
Experiment with it.

The database listings can get quite long.  Item <4>, ERASE/UNERASE DATABASE
RECORDS shows you ALL ACTIVE/ERASED records in the database.  Follow the
directions there for activating or erasing a database record.


The following summarizes the structure of the record entries in "PRECS.DAT" -
note that all numbers are HEX:

   ACTIVE or ERASED HEADER | RECORD LENGTH | RECORD | TEXT ID | 2 '0' BYTES

ACTIVE HEADER = FF FF FF FF 4B 26 57
ERASED HEADER = FF 0  0  FF 4B 26 57

RECORD LENGTH = 1 byte giving the length of the RECORD in bytes.

RECORD = complete record consisting of the ASCII name, blanks (0 value bytes),
	 data size bytes, and any data.

TEXT ID = User-entered text description of the database entry.  Up to 24 chars
	  long.

2 '0' BYTES = Two bytes having a value of 0.

When you "ERASE" a database entry, all that's changed is the entry's HEADER
contents.  The entry is still present in the database.  Use your own hex
editor to PERMANENTLY remove database entries.



*******************************************************************************
                  RETRIEVING/EDITING DATABASE RECORDS
Select MAIN MENU item <12> and go to the RECORD EDITING AND SAVING MENU.
Select item <2> to view the ACTIVE database records.  Select a record.  The
HEX/ASCII editor will be called to allow you to do any edits.  Exit the editor
by typing <done> at the prompt.

Once you are <done> with the editor, PREDIT will see if the record from the
database has a NAME that appears in the loaded SAV file.  If the database
record name matches a SAV file record name, you will be prompted for REPLACING
your SAV file record with the one you just edited from the database.

If your database record NAME DOES NOT MATCH a record name in the SAV file, you
will be prompted for INSERTING the record into your SAV file.  You will need
to know the FORM NUMBER and ORDER of the records for doing an insertion
operation (that won't hang the game).  FORMS are ordered in the file starting
with FORM 0, which usually contains the PLAYSCOR and KILL records.  The records
at the end of the SAV file which are not included in any FORM are designated as
being in FORM 255.  Follow the onscreen directions for doing the insertion.
Experiment!

***NOTE:  Throwing the DEBUG switch will let you SEE THE CONTENTS OF ALL FORMS
including FORM NUMBERS and RECORDS.




*******************************************************************************
                      ADDING RECORDS TO THE DATABASE
Select MAIN MENU item <12> and go to the RECORD EDITING AND SAVING MENU.
Call up a record from either your loaded SAV file (item <1>) or the database
(item <2>).  Edit the record if you need to.  Select item <3> to SAVE your
edited or unedited record to the database.  All new entries are made ACTIVE.





*******************************************************************************
   FOR THOSE WHO WISH TO ANALYZE OR WRITE ROUTINES TO MODIFY THEIR SAV FILES:
		            VIEWING MY DEBUG CODE
Privateer produces a SAV file that has VARIABLE LENGTH FORMS and RECORDS.  The
length of these records is based on your current ship setup, equipment, cargo,
etc.  To help and encourage others to experiment with their SAV files, I have
included a "DEBUG" switch (as a prompt on PREDIT startup) to let you view all
DEBUG listings.  Some listings get quite long but show you the general structure
of the SAV file, the FORM numbers, RECORD listings, etc.


Any programs or analysis routines you write MUST take these variable length
records into account.  In order to allow variable FORM/RECORD lengths,
Privateer creates a SAV file using the following general format:
	1)	The head of the file contains pointers to specific data
		areas in the file such as the pilot name string, call
		sign string, etc.
	2)	Data areas are called "FORMS" (in ASCII text), with each
		FORM having a specified length given immediately after the
		FORM name.  The author designates these FORMS in a one-up
		manner beginning with FORM 0 close to the start of the SAV file.
		The records at the end of the SAV file, not in a FORM, are
		designed as being in FORM 255.
	3) 	Inside the FORMS are RECORDS, with each RECORD having an
		ASCII name followed by the RECORD's DATA SIZE in bytes.
		The RECORD DATA immediately follows the DATA SIZE with the
		number of DATA bytes equal to the RECORD DATA SIZE value.
